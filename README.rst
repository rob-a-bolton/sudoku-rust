sudoku
======
A command line program to solve sudoku puzzles.
This is being used as a project to help me learn rust, so look elsewhere if you want a performant implementation.

Usage
=====
`sudoku -i <input_file>`

The input file is expected to be a series of puzzles, each separated
by a single line.

Here is an example puzzle formatted correctly

::

 input file:

    39   51
  546 183
       742
    9 5  3
  2  6 3  4
   8  7 2
   973
    182 947
  85   46  

*Note: "input file:" is NOT a part of the input file*
